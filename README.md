# Rs: Safer, Faster, Field-First Rust

> *Rust treats bytes as machine integers. Rs treats bytes as elements of F_p. This single shift makes determinism, content addressing, and bounded computation natural rather than enforced.*

---

## Abstract

Rs is a minimal, strict superset of Rust for building systems where every byte is a field element. Operating systems, blockchain nodes, and consensus machines share a common requirement: computation must be deterministic, bounded, and verifiable. Rust was designed for systems that manage memory safely. Rs extends Rust for systems that manage *state* safely — where the word is not a machine integer but an element of a finite field, and where correctness means every node in a network produces identical output for identical input.

Rs sits in a specific position within a computational language stack:

```
 Universe     Language   Type      Algebra            Purpose
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Binary       Bt         Bit       F_2 tower          Circuits
 Byte         Rs         Word      Bitwise on F_p     Systems
 Field        Trident    Field     Arithmetic on F_p  Proofs
```

Bt operates on bits for circuits. Trident operates on field elements for proofs. Rs is the **systems layer** between them — where bytes and words carry the algebraic structure of F_p but serve the practical needs of an operating system: registers, async I/O, state management, and module lifecycle.

Rs is implemented as a patch to `rustc` (~2,450 lines of compiler changes, ~5,400 lines of library code). Any valid Rust program compiles under Rs without modification. Rs adds seven compile-time guarantees that Rust cannot express, each a direct consequence of treating computation as algebraic rather than mechanical.

The file extension is `.rs`. The edition identifier is `rs`. The compiler binary is `rsc`.

---

## 1. Why Rs Exists

### 1.1 The Problem with Bytes-as-Integers

Rust, like C before it, treats bytes as machine integers. A `u64` is 64 bits that overflow, wrap, or trap depending on build mode. A `f64` produces different results on different architectures. A `HashMap` iterates in random order. Memory addresses are non-deterministic. This is fine for desktop applications and web servers — systems where "close enough" is acceptable and where a single machine is the trust boundary.

But there is a class of systems where this model breaks:

- **Consensus machines** where N nodes must produce bit-identical output
- **Operating systems** that never reboot and must hot-swap modules without state loss
- **Knowledge graphs** where data identity is derived from content, not location
- **Verifiable systems** where computation must be reproducible and provable

These systems need bytes to behave like elements of a finite field F_p: arithmetic that wraps predictably (mod p), operations that are deterministic by construction, and data structures whose identity is their content hash.

### 1.2 What Changes When Bytes Are Field Elements

When you treat the word as an element of F_p rather than a machine integer, seven consequences follow naturally:

1. **Hardware access becomes typed** — Registers are projections from field elements to bit ranges, not raw pointer dereferences. Safety is algebraic, not manual.
2. **Async must be bounded** — In a deterministic system, an unbounded wait is not just a bug but a consensus failure. Deadlines are part of the type, not an afterthought.
3. **Functions can be deterministic by construction** — If your arithmetic is over F_p, you don't need floats, random sources, or platform-dependent behavior. The compiler can verify this.
4. **Identity comes from content** — In F_p, equal values are identical. Content addressing (hashing to a CID) is the natural identity operation.
5. **State has temporal scope** — Field elements don't carry hidden history. State that should reset between epochs should be declared as such.
6. **Modules are algebraic cells** — A module with typed state, bounded interface, and migration rules is a morphism between system states.
7. **Allocation is bounded** — Field elements live in finite structures. Unbounded heap allocation is an escape from the algebraic model.

Rs doesn't invent these ideas. It makes them expressible in Rust's type system and enforceable by Rust's compiler.

### 1.3 Easier Adoption of Rust

Rs makes Rust easier to adopt for the systems that need it most. Today, writing a deterministic blockchain node in Rust requires hundreds of crate-level conventions, manual discipline around unsafe MMIO, ad-hoc timeout wrappers, and careful avoidance of non-deterministic constructs. Teams reinvent these patterns project by project. Rs captures them once, in the compiler, so that:

- Any Rust programmer can write correct deterministic code without learning project-specific conventions
- Any LLM trained on Rust can generate valid Rs
- Any existing no_std crate works unchanged
- Correctness is verified at compile time, not in code review

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Strict Superset

Every valid Rust program is a valid Rs program. This is a hard constraint, not a goal. Compatibility is verified by compiling the top 1000 no_std crates from crates.io with `rsc` on every CI run.

```
Valid Rust ⊂ Valid Rs
```

Rs adds constructs. It never changes the meaning of existing Rust constructs.

### 2.2 Edition-Gated Restrictions

Rs introduces an `rs` edition. When active, certain Rust features are restricted or enhanced:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]
edition = "rs"
```

In `rs` edition:
- Heap allocation primitives (`Box`, `Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`) produce compile errors unless explicitly opted-in via `#[allow(rs::heap)]`
- `dyn Trait` produces a compile error unless opted-in via `#[allow(rs::dynamic_dispatch)]`
- `panic!()` with unwinding produces a compile error; only `abort` mode is permitted
- Floating point types (`f32`, `f64`) are forbidden inside `#[deterministic]` functions
- All `async fn` must have a deadline (see §4)

In standard Rust editions (`2021`, `2024`), none of these restrictions apply. Rs extensions are still available but optional.

### 2.3 Zero New Keywords

Rs introduces zero new keywords. All extensions use:
- Attributes (`#[register]`, `#[deterministic]`, `#[epoch]`, `#[content_addressed]`)
- Attribute-like syntax on existing keywords (`async(duration)`)
- Macro-like declarations (`cell! { }`)

This ensures no conflict with any existing or future Rust syntax.

---

## 3. Typed Registers (MMIO without Unsafe)

### 3.1 Problem

Every Rust OS kernel uses `unsafe` for hardware register access. A typical kernel has hundreds to thousands of `unsafe { write_volatile(...) }` blocks scattered across driver code. Each one is a potential source of memory corruption if the address, width, or access pattern is wrong.

### 3.2 Solution

Rs introduces the `#[register]` attribute, which declares a memory-mapped I/O register as a typed, compiler-verified construct.

### 3.3 Syntax

```rust
#[register(base = 0x23B10_0000, bank_size = 0x1000)]
mod aic {
    /// Interrupt controller enable register
    #[reg(offset = 0x010, access = "rw")]
    pub struct Enable {
        #[field(bits = 0..1)]
        pub enabled: bool,

        #[field(bits = 1..5)]
        pub target_cpu: u8,

        #[field(bits = 5..7)]
        pub mode: IrqMode,

        // bits 7..32 are reserved (implicit, compiler warns if accessed)
    }

    /// Interrupt status register
    #[reg(offset = 0x014, access = "ro")]
    pub struct Status {
        #[field(bits = 0..16)]
        pub pending_irq: u16,

        #[field(bits = 16..20)]
        pub source: IrqSource,
    }

    /// Interrupt clear register
    #[reg(offset = 0x018, access = "wo")]
    pub struct Clear {
        #[field(bits = 0..16)]
        pub irq_mask: u16,
    }

    #[repr(u8)]
    pub enum IrqMode {
        Edge = 0,
        Level = 1,
        Hybrid = 2,
    }

    #[repr(u8)]
    pub enum IrqSource {
        Timer = 0,
        Gpio = 1,
        Ipc = 2,
        External = 3,
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Generated Code

The compiler generates:

```rust
// Auto-generated by rsc — user never writes this

impl aic::Enable {
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn read() -> Self {
        let raw: u32 = unsafe {
            core::ptr::read_volatile(0x23B10_0010 as *const u32)
        };
        Self {
            enabled: (raw & 0x1) != 0,
            target_cpu: ((raw >> 1) & 0xF) as u8,
            mode: unsafe { core::mem::transmute(((raw >> 5) & 0x3) as u8) },
        }
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn write<F: FnOnce(&mut Self)>(f: F) {
        let mut val = Self::default();
        f(&mut val);
        let raw: u32 = (val.enabled as u32)
            | ((val.target_cpu as u32 & 0xF) << 1)
            | ((val.mode as u32 & 0x3) << 5);
        unsafe {
            core::ptr::write_volatile(0x23B10_0010 as *mut u32, raw);
        }
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn modify<F: FnOnce(&mut Self)>(f: F) {
        let mut val = Self::read();
        f(&mut val);
        let raw: u32 = /* ... pack fields ... */;
        unsafe {
            core::ptr::write_volatile(0x23B10_0010 as *mut u32, raw);
        }
    }
}

// Status is read-only: no write() or modify() generated
// Clear is write-only: no read() or modify() generated
```

### 3.5 Compile-Time Guarantees

| Check | Example Error |
|-------|--------------|
| Read from write-only register | `error[RS001]: register aic::Clear is write-only` |
| Write to read-only register | `error[RS002]: register aic::Status is read-only` |
| Field exceeds register width | `error[RS003]: field target_cpu (bits 1..5) exceeds u32 width` |
| Field value exceeds bit range | `error[RS004]: value 20 does not fit in 4-bit field target_cpu` |
| Overlapping field bits | `error[RS005]: fields enabled and target_cpu overlap at bit 1` |
| Enum variant exceeds field width | `error[RS006]: IrqMode has 3 variants but field mode is 2 bits (max 4)` |
| Address outside declared bank | `error[RS007]: offset 0x2000 exceeds bank_size 0x1000` |

### 3.6 Usage

```rust
fn configure_interrupts() {
    // Fully safe — no unsafe anywhere in user code
    aic::Enable::write(|r| {
        r.enabled = true;
        r.target_cpu = 0;
        r.mode = IrqMode::Edge;
    });

    let status = aic::Status::read();
    if status.pending_irq > 0 {
        aic::Clear::write(|r| {
            r.irq_mask = status.pending_irq;
        });
    }

    // Compile error: Status is read-only
    // aic::Status::write(|r| { r.pending_irq = 0; });
}
```

### 3.7 Unsafe Accounting

The `unsafe` blocks exist only inside compiler-generated code. They are:
- Exactly 2 per register (one `read_volatile`, one `write_volatile`)
- Generated from verified attribute metadata
- Not visible to or writable by the user
- Auditable in compiler source (~200 lines of codegen)

User-facing code contains zero `unsafe`.

### 3.8 Fallback Compatibility

In standard Rust mode (non-Rs edition), `#[register]` can be implemented as a proc-macro crate that generates the same code. This means Rs register declarations are valid Rust with the right dependency — they just lack the compiler-level verification.

---

## 4. Bounded Async

### 4.1 Problem

Rust's `async fn` creates futures with no deadline. A forgotten `.await` on a network read can block a task forever. In OS kernels and blockchain nodes, this is not a bug — it is a liveness failure that can cost real money (slashing) or crash a system.

Existing workarounds (`tokio::time::timeout()`) are opt-in and forgettable. They are library-level, not language-level.

### 4.2 Solution

Rs extends `async` with an optional deadline parameter.

### 4.3 Syntax

```rust
// Standard Rust async — still valid, still works
async fn standard_function() -> Result<()> {
    // ...
}

// Rs bounded async — deadline is part of the function signature
async(100ms) fn read_block(lba: u64) -> Result<Block> {
    let data = device.read(lba).await;  // .await inherits 100ms deadline
    Ok(Block::from(data))
}

// Duration expressions allowed
async(Duration::from_secs(5)) fn sync_state() -> Result<()> {
    // ...
}

// Constant expressions allowed
const CONSENSUS_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_millis(500);
async(CONSENSUS_TIMEOUT) fn propose_block() -> Result<Block> {
    // ...
}
```

### 4.4 Semantics

When `async(D) fn foo() -> T` is called:

1. An internal timer starts with duration `D`
2. Every `.await` inside the function checks the remaining time
3. If the timer expires before the function returns, the future resolves to `Err(Rs::Timeout)`
4. The return type is transparently wrapped: `async(D) fn foo() -> T` actually returns `Result<T, Rs::Timeout>` at the future level

Nested calls:

```rust
async(200ms) fn outer() -> Result<()> {
    // inner gets at most the REMAINING time of outer, not its own 100ms
    // if outer has 50ms left, inner's effective deadline is 50ms
    let result = inner().await;
    Ok(())
}

async(100ms) fn inner() -> Result<Data> {
    // ...
}
```

The effective deadline is `min(own_deadline, caller_remaining)`. Deadlines propagate inward, never expand.

### 4.5 Rs Edition Enforcement

In `edition = "rs"`:

```rust
// ERROR in rs edition: async fn without deadline
async fn unbounded() -> Result<()> {
    //~^ error[RS101]: async functions must have a deadline in rs edition
    //~| help: add a deadline: async(100ms) fn unbounded()
}

// OK: explicit opt-out for rare cases (must justify)
#[allow(rs::unbounded_async)]
async fn special_case() -> Result<()> {
    // ...
}
```

In standard Rust editions, `async(duration)` is available but not required.

### 4.6 Compiler Implementation

The parser recognizes `async ( <expr> )` as a bounded async marker. The desugaring:

```rust
// Source:
async(100ms) fn foo(x: u32) -> Result<Bar> {
    let a = something().await;
    Ok(a.into())
}

// Desugared to (approximately):
fn foo(x: u32) -> impl Future<Output = Result<Result<Bar>, rs::Timeout>> {
    rs::runtime::with_deadline(Duration::from_millis(100), async move {
        let a = something().await;
        Ok(a.into())
    })
}
```

Parser changes: ~200 lines. Desugaring: ~300 lines. Diagnostic messages: ~100 lines.

## 5. Deterministic Functions

### 5.1 Problem

Blockchain consensus requires that every node produces identical output for identical input. Rust does not guarantee this. Floating point operations can produce different results on different architectures. Integer overflow behavior depends on debug/release mode. Memory layout of structs is unspecified.

### 5.2 Solution

The `#[deterministic]` attribute marks functions that must produce identical results on all platforms.

### 5.3 Syntax

```rust
#[deterministic]
fn compute_rank(weights: &[FixedPoint<u128, 18>]) -> FixedPoint<u128, 18> {
    let mut sum = FixedPoint::ZERO;
    for w in weights {
        sum = sum.checked_add(*w)?;  // checked arithmetic required
    }
    sum
}
```

### 5.4 Compile-Time Checks

Inside a `#[deterministic]` function, the compiler rejects:

| Rejected Construct | Reason | Error Code |
|---|---|---|
| `f32`, `f64` types | Non-deterministic across platforms | RS201 |
| `as` casts involving floats | Rounding is platform-dependent | RS202 |
| Raw pointer arithmetic | Addresses are non-deterministic | RS203 |
| `std::time::Instant` | Wall clock is non-deterministic | RS204 |
| `rand::*` | Randomness is non-deterministic | RS205 |
| Unchecked arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`) | Overflow behavior differs debug/release | RS206 |
| `HashMap` iteration | Order is non-deterministic | RS207 |
| Inline assembly | Platform-specific by definition | RS208 |
| Calling non-`#[deterministic]` functions | Transitivity requirement | RS209 |

### 5.5 What IS Allowed

- `FixedPoint<T, DECIMALS>` (Rs built-in fixed-point type)
- `checked_add`, `checked_mul`, `checked_sub`, `checked_div`
- `saturating_*` arithmetic
- `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet` (deterministic iteration order)
- Arrays, slices with deterministic indexing
- Other `#[deterministic]` functions
- `const fn` (already deterministic)
- All comparison and logical operations

### 5.6 Transitivity

Determinism is contagious upward and required downward:

```rust
#[deterministic]
fn outer() -> u64 {
    inner()  // OK only if inner() is also #[deterministic]
}

#[deterministic]
fn inner() -> u64 {
    42
}

fn non_det() -> u64 {
    outer()  // OK: non-deterministic can call deterministic
}
```

### 5.7 Built-in FixedPoint Type

Rs provides a built-in fixed-point numeric type:

```rust
// FixedPoint<BaseType, DecimalPlaces>
type Rank = FixedPoint<u128, 18>;   // 18 decimal places, u128 backing

let a: Rank = Rank::from_integer(42);
let b: Rank = Rank::from_raw(42_000_000_000_000_000_000u128); // 42.0
let c = a.checked_add(b).unwrap();
let d = a.checked_mul(b).unwrap();

// All operations are deterministic, checked, no floats
```

Compiler implementation: ~400 lines (lint pass + diagnostics).

---

## 6. Content-Addressed Types

### 6.1 Problem

In content-addressed systems, data is identified by its hash. Producing the hash requires canonical serialization — the same data must always serialize to the same bytes. Rust has no built-in concept of canonical serialization or content-derived identity.

### 6.2 Solution

The `#[content_addressed]` derive macro generates canonical serialization and a `.cid()` method.

### 6.3 Syntax

```rust
#[derive(ContentAddressed)]
struct Cyberlink {
    from: Cid,
    to: Cid,
    agent: Address,
    height: u64,
}

let link = Cyberlink { from: a, to: b, agent: alice, height: 100 };
let id: Cid = link.cid();  // Deterministic, canonical hash

// Two identical structs always produce the same CID
let link2 = Cyberlink { from: a, to: b, agent: alice, height: 100 };
assert_eq!(link.cid(), link2.cid());
```

### 6.4 Canonical Serialization Rules

The derived serializer follows strict rules:

1. Fields are serialized in declaration order (not alphabetical, not random)
2. Integers are serialized as little-endian fixed-width bytes
3. Variable-length types (arrays) are prefixed with a u32 length
4. No padding bytes between fields
5. Enums serialized as discriminant (u32) + variant data
6. Nested `ContentAddressed` types are serialized as their CID (32 bytes), not expanded

Hash function: Blake3 (256-bit output, producing a CID).

### 6.5 Compile-Time Checks

| Check | Error |
|-------|-------|
| Field type not serializable | `error[RS301]: type MyOpaqueType does not implement CanonicalSerialize` |
| Contains `f32`/`f64` | `error[RS302]: floating point types are not canonically serializable` |
| Contains raw pointers | `error[RS303]: pointers cannot be content-addressed` |
| Contains `HashMap` | `error[RS304]: HashMap has non-deterministic serialization; use BTreeMap` |

### 6.6 Implementation

Implemented as a proc-macro (no compiler changes required). Works in both standard Rust and Rs editions. ~500 lines.

---

## 7. Epoch-Scoped State

### 7.1 Problem

Long-running systems accumulate state. A variable set in block N might still be non-zero in block N+1000 because someone forgot to clear it. This is a source of non-determinism and state leaks.

### 7.2 Solution

The `#[epoch]` attribute marks state that is automatically reset at epoch boundaries.

### 7.3 Syntax

```rust
#[epoch]
static PENDING_TXS: Mutex<BoundedVec<Transaction, 10_000>> =
    Mutex::new(BoundedVec::new());

#[epoch]
static VOTES_THIS_ROUND: AtomicU32 = AtomicU32::new(0);

fn process_transaction(tx: Transaction) {
    PENDING_TXS.lock().push(tx);
    // At epoch boundary, PENDING_TXS is automatically reset to empty
    // No manual cleanup required. Forgetting is impossible.
}
```

### 7.4 Semantics

The runtime calls `EpochState::reset()` at the beginning of each epoch (block). This is injected by the cell infrastructure, not by user code.

```rust
// Compiler generates this trait impl for every #[epoch] static:
impl EpochReset for BoundedVec<Transaction, 10_000> {
    fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.clear();
    }
}

// At epoch boundary (generated by cell! macro):
fn __epoch_reset() {
    PENDING_TXS.lock().reset();
    VOTES_THIS_ROUND.store(0, Ordering::SeqCst);
}
```

### 7.5 Compile-Time Checks

In `edition = "rs"`, accessing an `#[epoch]` variable outside of an epoch context is an error:

```rust
#[epoch]
static COUNTER: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

// OK: inside a cell function (has epoch context)
cell! {
    name: MyCell,
    pub fn tick(&self) {
        COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);  // OK
    }
}

// ERROR: outside cell context
fn standalone() {
    COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
    //~^ error[RS401]: #[epoch] state accessed outside of cell context
}
```

Implementation: ~300 lines (attribute handling + lint pass).

---

## 8. Cell Declarations

### 8.1 Problem

Operating system modules need: a private state, a public interface, a resource budget, health monitoring, hot-swap capability, and state migration between versions. Rust has none of these as a first-class concept. Crates provide modularity but not lifecycle management.

### 8.2 Solution

The `cell!` macro declares a self-contained, hot-swappable OS module.

### 8.3 Syntax

```rust
cell! {
    name: Consensus,
    version: 3,
    budget: 500ms,
    heartbeat: 1s,

    state {
        validators: BTreeMap<Address, StakeAmount>,
        current_round: u64,
        votes: BoundedVec<Vote, MAX_VALIDATORS>,
    }

    // Epoch-scoped state (auto-reset each block)
    epoch_state {
        round_votes: BoundedVec<Vote, MAX_VALIDATORS>,
        proposed_block: Option<Block>,
    }

    // Public interface — other cells can call these
    pub fn propose_block(&self, txs: &[Transaction]) -> Result<Block> {
        // ...
    }

    pub async(200ms) fn vote(&mut self, block: &Block) -> Result<Vote> {
        // ...
    }

    pub fn validator_set(&self) -> &BTreeMap<Address, StakeAmount> {
        &self.state.validators
    }

    // Private functions — internal to cell
    fn verify_proposer(&self, proposer: Address) -> bool {
        self.state.validators.contains_key(&proposer)
    }

    // State migration from previous version
    migrate from v2 {
        validators: old.validators,
        current_round: old.current_round,
        votes: BoundedVec::new(), // new field in v3
    }
}
```

### 8.4 Generated Code

The `cell!` macro generates:

```rust
// 1. State struct
pub struct ConsensusState {
    validators: BTreeMap<Address, StakeAmount>,
    current_round: u64,
    votes: BoundedVec<Vote, MAX_VALIDATORS>,
}

// 2. Epoch state struct (with auto-reset)
#[epoch]
pub struct ConsensusEpochState {
    round_votes: BoundedVec<Vote, MAX_VALIDATORS>,
    proposed_block: Option<Block>,
}

// 3. Cell struct wrapping both
pub struct Consensus {
    state: ConsensusState,
    epoch_state: ConsensusEpochState,
}

// 4. Cell trait implementation
impl Cell for Consensus {
    const NAME: &'static str = "Consensus";
    const VERSION: u32 = 3;
    const BUDGET: Duration = Duration::from_millis(500);
    const HEARTBEAT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(1);

    fn health_check(&self) -> HealthStatus { /* ... */ }
    fn reset_epoch_state(&mut self) { self.epoch_state.reset(); }
}

// 5. Migration from v2
impl MigrateFrom<ConsensusStateV2> for ConsensusState {
    fn migrate(old: ConsensusStateV2) -> Self {
        Self {
            validators: old.validators,
            current_round: old.current_round,
            votes: BoundedVec::new(),
        }
    }
}

// 6. Public interface methods (impl block)
impl Consensus {
    pub fn propose_block(&self, txs: &[Transaction]) -> Result<Block> { /* ... */ }
    pub async(200ms) fn vote(&mut self, block: &Block) -> Result<Vote> { /* ... */ }
    pub fn validator_set(&self) -> &BTreeMap<Address, StakeAmount> { /* ... */ }
    fn verify_proposer(&self, proposer: Address) -> bool { /* ... */ }
}

// 7. Metadata for introspection
impl CellMetadata for Consensus {
    fn interface() -> &'static [FunctionSignature] {
        &[
            FunctionSignature { name: "propose_block", args: &["&[Transaction]"], ret: "Result<Block>" },
            FunctionSignature { name: "vote", args: &["&Block"], ret: "Result<Vote>", deadline: Some(200) },
            FunctionSignature { name: "validator_set", args: &[], ret: "&BTreeMap<Address, StakeAmount>" },

### 8.5 Hot-Swap Protocol

```
 Epoch N          Epoch N+1        Epoch N+2
 ┌──────┐        ┌──────────┐     ┌──────┐
 │Cell  │  drain │Cell v2    │     │Cell  │
 │v1    │───────>│loading +  │────>│v2    │
 │active│        │migration  │     │active│
 └──────┘        └──────────┘     └──────┘
                  state transfer
                  via MigrateFrom
```

1. Governance approves new cell binary
2. Current epoch completes normally
3. At epoch boundary: old cell's state is serialized
4. `MigrateFrom::migrate()` transforms state to new version
5. New cell is initialized with migrated state
6. New cell starts processing next epoch
7. Old cell binary is unloaded

Total downtime: zero. Migration happens in the gap between epochs.

Implementation: proc-macro, ~2000 lines.

## 9. Owned Regions

### 9.1 Problem

Rust's borrow checker is designed for complex ownership graphs: multiple references with different lifetimes, interior mutability, self-referential structs. This complexity exists to support general-purpose programming. An OS kernel for a blockchain node doesn't need most of it.

### 9.2 Solution

In `edition = "rs"`, the compiler enforces a simpler ownership model through lints. This is not a language change — it's a restriction.

### 9.3 Restrictions

```rust
#![edition = "rs"]

// FORBIDDEN (unless opted-in):

let x = Box::new(42);
//~^ error[RS501]: heap allocation forbidden in rs edition
//~| help: use a stack value or Arena<T, N>

let v = Vec::new();
//~^ error[RS502]: growable collections forbidden in rs edition
//~| help: use BoundedVec<T, N> with compile-time capacity

let s = String::from("hello");
//~^ error[RS503]: heap-allocated strings forbidden in rs edition
//~| help: use &str or ArrayString<N>

let d: Box<dyn Trait> = ...;
//~^ error[RS504]: dynamic dispatch forbidden in rs edition
//~| help: use generics or enum dispatch

let r = Arc::new(data);
//~^ error[RS505]: reference counting forbidden in rs edition
//~| help: use cell-owned state or bounded channels

// ALLOWED:

let a: [u8; 1024] = [0; 1024];                          // stack allocation
let arena: Arena<Transaction, 10_000> = Arena::new();    // typed arena, compile-time sized
let bv: BoundedVec<u8, 256> = BoundedVec::new();        // bounded, no heap
let s: ArrayString<64> = ArrayString::from("hello");     // fixed-capacity string
```

### 9.4 Arena Allocator

Rs provides a built-in arena type for cases where dynamic-count-but-bounded allocation is needed:

```rust
// Arena with compile-time maximum capacity
let arena: Arena<Transaction, 10_000> = Arena::new();

// Allocate returns Option — None if arena is full
let tx: &mut Transaction = arena.alloc(Transaction::default())?;

// All allocations freed when arena goes out of scope
// No individual deallocation — this is by design
// No fragmentation, no use-after-free, no leaks
```

### 9.5 Explicit Opt-In

For interfacing with existing Rust crates that use heap allocation:

```rust
#[allow(rs::heap)]
mod legacy_compat {
    use some_crate::SomeType;  // This crate uses Vec internally
    // OK: heap restrictions lifted in this module
}
```

Implementation: ~500 lines (lint pass checking for specific type paths).

## 10. Rs Standard Library Extensions

### 10.1 `rs::fixed_point`

```rust
use rs::fixed_point::FixedPoint;

type Amount = FixedPoint<u128, 18>;  // 18 decimal places

let a = Amount::from_integer(100);
let b = Amount::from_decimal(3, 14);  // 3.14
let c = a.checked_mul(b).unwrap();    // 314.00...
let d = a.checked_div(b).unwrap();    // 31.847...

// All operations: checked_add, checked_sub, checked_mul, checked_div
// All deterministic, all return Option (no panics)
```

### 10.2 `rs::bounded`

```rust
use rs::bounded::{BoundedVec, BoundedMap, ArrayString};

let mut v: BoundedVec<u8, 256> = BoundedVec::new();
v.try_push(42)?;  // Returns Err if full

let mut m: BoundedMap<Key, Value, 1000> = BoundedMap::new();
m.try_insert(k, v)?;  // Returns Err if full

let s: ArrayString<64> = ArrayString::try_from("hello")?;
```

### 10.3 `rs::channel`

```rust
use rs::channel::{bounded_channel, Sender, Receiver};

// Wait-free bounded MPMC channel
let (tx, rx) = bounded_channel::<Transaction>(1000);

// Non-blocking send
match tx.try_send(transaction) {
    Ok(()) => { /* sent */ }
    Err(Full(tx)) => { /* channel full, backpressure */ }
}

// Bounded receive (with deadline from async context)
let msg = rx.recv().await;  // Inherits caller's deadline
```

### 10.4 `rs::cid`

```rust
use rs::cid::Cid;

let data = b"hello world";
let cid = Cid::from_bytes(data);  // Blake3 hash

// Cid is Copy, 32 bytes, comparable, hashable
let map: BoundedMap<Cid, Data, 10_000> = BoundedMap::new();
```

### 10.5 `rs::arena`

```rust
use rs::arena::Arena;

let arena: Arena<MyStruct, 5000> = Arena::new();
let item: &mut MyStruct = arena.alloc(MyStruct::new())?;

// Arena tracks count, provides iteration
assert!(arena.count() <= 5000);
for item in arena.iter() { /* ... */ }

// All freed on drop — no individual deallocation
```

The actual rustc patch is ~2,450 lines. Everything else is standard Rust crates that work with both `rsc` and `rustc`.

### 11.3 Build Pipeline

```bash
# Rs compiler is a patched rustc
$ git clone https://github.com/AnyOrganization/rust.git rsc
$ cd rsc
$ git apply rs-compiler.patch   # ~2,450 lines
$ ./x.py build

# Compiles any .rs file
$ rsc my_program.rs                    # standard Rust mode
$ rsc --edition rs my_program.rs       # Rs mode with all checks

# Or via Cargo
$ cargo +rsc build                     # uses rsc as compiler
```

### 11.4 Compatibility Testing

CI runs three test suites:

1. **Rust test suite**: the full rustc test suite must pass with rsc (zero regressions)
2. **Top 1000 no_std crates**: compile with rsc to verify superset property
3. **Rs-specific tests**: test all 7 primitives, all error codes, all edge cases

---

## 12. Migration Path

### Phase 1: Library-Only (works today)

Before the compiler patch exists, all Rs concepts except two can be used as standard Rust crates:

| Primitive | Library Implementation | Limitation |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Typed registers | `rs-registers` proc-macro | No compiler verification of MMIO safety |
| Bounded async | `rs-async` with timeout wrapper | Not enforced, opt-in |
| Deterministic functions | `rs-deterministic` proc-macro | Partial: catches float but not all cases |
| Content-addressed types | `rs-cid` derive macro | Full functionality |
| Epoch-scoped state | `rs-epoch` attribute macro | No cross-cell enforcement |
| Cell declarations | `rs-cell` proc-macro | Full functionality |
| Owned regions | `rs-lint` clippy plugin | Advisory warnings, not errors |

This means CyberOS development can start immediately using standard Rust with Rs libraries.

### Phase 2: Compiler Patch

Apply the ~2,450 line patch to rustc. All library-based Rs code continues to work. Compiler now also enforces:
- MMIO safety at compile time
- Bounded async as requirement in Rs edition
- Deterministic function purity
- Heap/dyn restrictions in Rs edition

### Phase 3: Upstream

Propose individual Rs features as Rust RFCs where appropriate:
- `#[deterministic]` has general value beyond CyberOS
- Bounded async could benefit any reliability-critical Rust code
- Typed registers would benefit the entire embedded Rust ecosystem

Features that are too domain-specific remain in the Rs fork.

---

## 13. Example: Complete CyberOS Cell in Rs

```rust
#![edition = "rs"]

use rs::prelude::*;

// Hardware register for network DMA
#[register(base = 0x4000_0000, bank_size = 0x100)]
mod net_dma {
    #[reg(offset = 0x00, access = "rw")]
    pub struct Control {
        #[field(bits = 0..1)]

        for (_, link) in self.state.links.iter() {

```

This file:
- Is valid Rs (compiles with `rsc --edition rs`)
- Is *almost* valid standard Rust (compiles with `rustc` if Rs proc-macros are available, minus `async(50ms)` syntax)
- Has zero `unsafe`
- Has compile-time MMIO verification
- Has determinism guarantees on state transitions
- Has bounded async on all queries
- Has content-addressed data by default
- Has auto-resetting epoch state
- Has hot-swap capability with state migration
- Can be generated by any LLM that knows Rust

---

## 14. Summary

Rs is not a new language. It is Rust with seven additions for systems where every byte is a field element:

| # | Primitive | Compiler Change | Library | Key Guarantee |
|---|-----------|:-:|:-:|---|
| 1 | Typed Registers | 800L codegen | — | MMIO without unsafe |
| 2 | Bounded Async | 500L parse+desugar | — | No unbounded waits |
| 3 | Deterministic Fns | 400L lint | — | Same output everywhere |
| 4 | Content-Addressed | — | 500L proc-macro | Identity from content |
| 5 | Epoch State | — | 300L proc-macro | No state leaks |
| 6 | Cells | — | 2000L proc-macro | Hot-swap + lifecycle |
| 7 | Owned Regions | 250L lint | — | No heap, no leaks |

Total compiler patch: **~2,450 lines**.
Total library code: **~5,400 lines**.
Compatibility: **100% with existing Rust**.
File extension: **`.rs`**.

Any Rust programmer can write Rs. Any LLM trained on Rust can generate Rs. Any no_std crate works with Rs. The ecosystem is not forked — it is extended.

Rust made systems programming safe. Rs makes it algebraic. When the word is a field element, determinism is not a discipline — it is the default.
